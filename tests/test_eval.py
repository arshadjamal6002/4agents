LLM-as-judge quality evaluation — Version 7.

Unlike the reference blog (which judges with a local Ollama model via
OllamaJudge), this project already runs every agent on the OpenAI API
(see README: "OpenAI instead of Ollama"). So the judge here — OpenAIJudge —
wires DeepEval's DeepEvalBaseLLM interface to ChatOpenAI instead of
ChatOllama. Everything else (metrics, thresholds, test structure) follows
the chapter as written.

These tests are slow (real LLM calls) and cost a handful of OpenAI
requests each run. They are excluded by default via pyproject.toml's
`addopts = "-m 'not eval'"` and only run with:

    pytest tests/test_eval.py -m eval -v -s
